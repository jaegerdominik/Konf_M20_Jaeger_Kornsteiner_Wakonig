#### Issues ####
-- We ran into issues with our push-/ pull workflow.
	Several times we had to merge our branches. 
	We believe that this was caused by us working on the same file simultaneously.
	Perhaps we caused it by not cleanly pulling our repositories before making changes.
	After we started to be mindful of this problem we ceased to have said issues.


### Task two ###

Step 1: Create a new branch e.g. Classname_JUnit
Step 2: Checkout into the new branch
Step 3: Create tests for each class
Step 3.5: In the process of Step 3, sometimes other classes need to be adjusted
Step 4: Add JavaDoc comments if not already done
Step 5: Add the modified files to git, then commit and push the changes
Step 6: Checkout into the main branch
Step 7: Merge the main branch with Classname_JUnit branch
Step 8: Push the merge to the remote repository
