## Steps with Git ##

### Task one ###

- Step1: Create Git-Repository
- Step1.1: Add teammebers to you Team and give them permission
- Step2: Push Drink-Smaple to Git
- Step2.1: Clone/Pull the Repository to all Team-Members
- Step3: Create a README.md template
- Step4: Specify the new java classes in the README.md
- Step5: Add the specified java classes to the java project
- Step6: Implement the Functions into the java classes
- Step7: git add class.java
- Step8: git commit -m "message"
- Step9: git push
- Step9.1: tell other Team Members to git pull
- Step10: repeat Step4 - Step9.1

#### Issues ####
-- We ran into issues with our push-/ pull workflow.
	Several times we had to merge our branches. 
	We believe that this was caused by us working on the same file simultaneously.
	Perhaps we caused it by not cleanly pulling our repositories before making changes.
	After we started to be mindful of this problem we ceased to have said issues.


### Task two ###

Step 1: Create a new branch e.g. Classname_JUnit
Step 2: Checkout into the new branch
Step 3: Create tests for each class
Step 3.5: In the process of Step 3, sometimes other classes need to be adjusted
Step 4: Add JavaDoc comments if not already done
Step 5: Add the modified files to git, then commit and push the changes
Step 6: Checkout into the main branch
Step 7: Merge the main branch with Classname_JUnit branch
Step 8: Push the merge to the remote repository 

#### Test coverage ####

The Classes HotDrink.java, Cocktail.java and Beer.java have all been tested with 100% coverage of methods and lines.
That being said, a real 100% coverage for tests can not be achieved, only a number of tests that we, as developers, think of are implemented.
The tests need to be added on; For now a simple set of test to compare the output of the methods has been added.
In following updates to the program we will need to add functionality to overflows, errors, events like power outages and so forth, as well as add more detail to the tests that we have already implemented.

#### JavaDoc Crashcourse ####

JavaDoc is a writing standard for documentation of code in java. It helps to standardise how people write their code. It helps to keep an overview of your own code aswell as to read and understand code that others have written. 
Many IDEs also integrate support for JavaDoc, e.a. IntelliJ lets you hover your mouse over called method names and other things and shows the JavaDoc of that segment in a tooltip.
A typical JavaDoc comment would look like this:
 
 	`/**
     * Creates a drink object with given name, e.g. juice or orange juice
     *
     * @param name        	name of the drink
     * @param ingredients 	list of liquids
     */
     public HotDrink(String name, Liquid... ingredients){...}`

This is a method header that shows after @param which parameter the method needs. 

Other tags, as described in https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html are:

@author (classes and interfaces only, required)
@version (classes and interfaces only, required. See footnote 1)
@param (methods and constructors only)
@return (methods only)
@exception (@throws is a synonym added in Javadoc 1.2)
@see
@since
@serial (or @serialField or @serialData)
@deprecated (see How and When To Deprecate APIs)
