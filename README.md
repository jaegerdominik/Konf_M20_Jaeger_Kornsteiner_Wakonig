## Issues ##
-- We ran into issues with our push-/ pull workflow.
	Several times we had to merge our branches. 
	We believe that this was caused by us working on the same file simultaneously.
	Perhaps we caused it by not cleanly pulling our repositories before making changes.
	After we started to be mindful of this problem we ceased to have said issues.
