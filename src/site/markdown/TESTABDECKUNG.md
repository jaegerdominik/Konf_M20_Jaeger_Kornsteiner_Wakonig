# Test coverage #

All Classes have been tested with 100% coverage of methods and lines.
That being said, a real 100% coverage for tests can not be achieved, only a number of tests that we, as developers, think of are implemented.
The tests need to be added on; For now a simple set of test to compare the output of the methods has been added.
In following updates to the program we will need to add functionality to overflows, errors, events like power outages and so forth, as well as add more detail to the tests that we have already implemented.
